## API Limitations

**Note**: Due to Figma API limitations, the "Reset" function cannot completely remove variable mode assignments. Instead, it resets modes to their default (first) state. This is a known limitation acknowledged by Figma's engineering team.

## Compatibility

- **Figma Version**: Works with all recent versions of Figma
- **Collections**: Supports both local and team library variable collections
- **Modes**: Compatible with all variable collection modes
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (Figma Desktop recommended)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Themes not appearing in dropdown**
- Ensure you have variable collections with multiple modes
- Check that collections are properly published (for team libraries)
- Refresh the plugin if collections were recently modified

**Reset not working as expected**
- This is expected behavior due to Figma API limitations
- Reset sets modes to default rather than removing assignments completely

**Plugin not loading**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure manifest.json is properly formatted
- Try refreshing Figma and reopening the plugin

### Getting Help
- Check the [Issues](../../issues) page for known problems
- Create a new issue with detailed steps to reproduce
- Include your Figma version and browser information
